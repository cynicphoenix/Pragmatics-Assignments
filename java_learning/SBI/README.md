# SBI
 
 ## Overview 
 
 A new banking service has just started in India and the name of this bank is Serious Bank of India (SBI).  They have an online portal where the customers can login and transfer their money from one SBI account to another SBI account. Lately customers have started complaining to SBI that they have to wait for several minutes for their online transfers to complete. SBIâ€™s IT team has investigated this complaint and found that the bottleneck is due to slow processing of transactions. At any given time there are millions of transactions waiting to happen but their software performs all the transactions sequentially. They have approached you to help them in parallelizing their software.

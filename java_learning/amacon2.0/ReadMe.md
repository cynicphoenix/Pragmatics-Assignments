 # AMACON 2.0
 
 ## Overview 
 
 In Version 2.0, you have to extend the Amacon.com platform to make it more user-friendly and to ensure that the system is also foolproof. These new set of requirements from Amacon.com are as following:

- Version 2.0 platform should welcome recurring customers. It should be able to identify each customer by a unique username (case sensitive) and save the customerâ€™s cart state after each session. Platform should allow the returning customer to recall their cart the next time they log in Amacon.com.
- Version 1.0 (Question 1) platform is extremely impractical for the admins as they have to re-initialise the database before every admin sessions. Version 2.0 platform should maintain the last modified state of its database across all admin and customer sessions.
- Version 2.0 platform should be robust to corner cases and should never crash. JUnit based unit testing is a good way of testing your platform effectively and comprehensively. You have to design a JUnit Test Suite for the Amacon system that contains different JUnit test cases.
